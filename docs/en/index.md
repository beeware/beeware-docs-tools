# BeeWare Docs Tools Demo

## Theme checklist

Things to manually check:

### Titlebar

A dark gray titlebar is on the page. This confirms the theme template
has been applied.

### Header and logo icons

The header icon top-left has been rendered. This confirms the template
can reference external resources.

The logo icon in the left sidebar has been rendered. This confirms the
sidebar will render properly on the target sites.

### Heading font

Headings are rendered in Cutive. This confirms the BeeWare custom CSS
theme has been applied.

### Inline Code

Inline code is rendered in the same color as the surrounding font. This
confirms that the theme has not caused any undesired changes.

This is text with `inline code` here and `inline code` here.

### Tabbed Content Code

Code is in a contrasting color to the background. Copy button should
copy only the commands; the prompt should not be included.

This confirms that the theme has not caused any undesired changes,
as well as whether the copy button is working as expected.

/// tab | macOS

$ git clone https://github.com/beeware/beeware-theme.git
```

### Sidebar links

Sidebar links exist, and point to the `beeware-docs-tools` repo. This
confirms that the sidebar content has been loaded, and the `project-name`
has been set in the MkDocs configuration file.

### Translation Admonition

The English-language version of this document should show the "Translations
are available" admonition below. The French translation should show the "This is
a translation!" admonition.

To view the "This is a machine translation!" admonition, change the
`extra: translation_type:` in the `mkdocs.fr.yml` file to `machine`.

{% if config.extra.translation_type == original %}

/// admonition | Translations are available

If you're not comfortable with English, translations of the Docs Tools
are available in Fran√ßais.

///

{% endif %}

{% if config.extra.translation_type == machine %}

/// admonition | This is a machine translation!

This version of the tutorial has been generated by machine translation.
We know this isn't ideal, but we felt that a bad translation was better
than no translation at all.

///

{% endif %}

{% if config.extra.translation_type == human %}

/// admonition | This is a translation!

This document is a translation of the English version. The translation
has been reviewed by humans, but newer sections may be generated by
machine translation, or not translated at all.

///

{% endif %}

### Custom static content

The title of this section is rendered in dark red. This confirms that
the docs project can still provide static content.

*This is not currently implemented, but may be in the future.*
