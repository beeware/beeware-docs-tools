# reStructuredText to Markdown Conversion Scripts

The scripts included here were used in the process of moving the BeeWare documentation
from Sphinx reStructuredText, to Markdown and MkDocs. They are not an active part of
the BeeWare Docs tools, and are included here purely for archival purposes. They are
therefore not maintained or supported in any way. You are free to use and modify them
for your own needs.
